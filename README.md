# Behavior-Driven Simulation for Human Decision Modeling

#Overview

This repository presents a research project that explores how interactive simulations and gamification can improve human decision-making under threat scenarios. It bridges behavioral psychology, gamification theory, and simulation design to create measurable improvements in detection, response, and communication behaviors.

# Problem

Human error is the leading contributor to system-level failures, especially in cybersecurity and high-risk environments. Employees often:

- Fail to detect threats  
- Respond too slowly to incidents  
- Miscommunicate critical information  

The challenge: design a system that motivates behavior change and supports learning through experience.
